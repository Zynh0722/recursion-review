// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:
// var parseJSON = JSON.parse;

// but you're not, so you'll write it from scratch:
var parseJSON = function(json) {

  var object = {};

  // if curly brace or square bracket, it's array or object and call that function

  // Will need to account for whitespace and escape characters eventually

  // Identify value based on first character
  // Based on value,


  // String - start with "
  //


  return object;
};
